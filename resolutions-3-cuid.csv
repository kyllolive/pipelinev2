WHEREAS, the need of a school building in Marigondon Elementary School, Division of Lapu-Lapu City had always been the dream of the School Administrator as well as its school children which could provide them a better learning facilities in household chores;

WHEREAS, due to the limitations of the city's financial resources there is no assurance that the City could provide a school building for Marigondon Elementary School.

WHEREAS, it is, this belief, after all there is no harm in trying that, we should try to request Senator Santanina T. Rasul to set aside from her pork barrel the sum of ₱500,000.00 to finance for the construction of two (2) units school building in Marigondon Elementary School, Division of Lapu-Lapu City.

NOW THEREFORE, on motion of Hon. Placido L. Ngujo duly seconded by Hon. Sheila V. Alegre,

BE IT RESOLVED, as it is hereby being resolved, to request Senator Santanina T. Rasul to set aside from her pork barrel the sum of ₱500,000.00 to finance for the construction of the two (2) units School Building in Barangay Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City.

RASUL TO SET ASIDE FROM HER PORK BARREL THE SUM OF ₱500,000.00 TO FINANCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO (2) UNIT SCHOOL BUILDING IN BARANGAY MARIGONSON, LAPU-LAPU CITY",,1995-01-31,,,"Resolution No. 2609-95-B primarily serves as a non-binding request directed towards Senator Santanina T. Rasul, urging her to allocate ₱500,000. 00 from her pork barrel for the construction of two unit school buildings in Barangay Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City. This resolution stems from the persistent demand for improved educational facilities at Marigondon Elementary School, which lacks a proper school building. Despite acknowledging the city's financial constraints, proponents believe that requesting this allocation through Senator Rasul presents a viable opportunity, with no potential harm. The key compliance requirement outlined in this resolution involves adherence to the principles governing requests for pork barrel allocations. While not legally binding, such requests typically necessitate respect for transparency, accountability, and good faith negotiation. The primary enforcement mechanism here lies within the political process, where the credibility and influence of the requesting officials may sway the recipient's decision. Although no explicit penalties or sanctions are specified, failure to consider the request could potentially affect the relationship between local government units and senators, influencing future funding opportunities. Implementation of this resolution hinges on Senator Rasul's discretionary power over her pork barrel funds. If approved, the allocated ₱500,000. 00 would directly fund the construction project in Barangay Marigondon. There are no specified timelines or effective dates beyond the initial request itself. Citizens and relevant stakeholders must remain vigilant regarding any updates or developments stemming from this resolution, as its success depends largely on the political dynamics and priorities of involved parties.",

Key regulations include the requirement for these officials to utilize the information provided for decision-making related to the city's budget and finances. While the resolution does not explicitly outline major prohibited activities or substantial restrictions, it underscores the necessity for adherence to established financial policies and procedures. Compliance obligations lie with these designated officials who must ensure accurate budget execution and reporting, as well as maintaining transparency in financial matters. Enforcement primarily rests with the City Secretary, who certifies the resolution's accuracy, and the Vice Mayor and City Mayor, who serve as presiding officers. Penalties or sanctions are not detailed in this resolution; however, non-compliance could potentially lead to administrative actions or consequences stemming from broader financial regulations. The resolution does not specify critical licensing or permit requirements directly. However, it emphasizes the importance of financial prudence and transparency, which may indirectly affect business operations and licensing processes within the affected barangays. Citizens and businesses should anticipate increased scrutiny over financial practices and expenditures, with potential implications for funding allocations and project approvals. Effective date and implementation timelines are not explicitly stated, suggesting immediate applicability upon distribution to relevant officials.

COMMITTEE REPORT

ON THE COMPLAINT OF MR. LUCENIO L. GARCIA AGAINST PUNONG BARANGAY LYNDELL T. BULLOS OF BRGY. PAJO, LAPU-LAPU CITY. THE CASE WAS FIRST FILED BEFORE THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN (VISAYAS), WAS FURTHER REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE DILG, REGION V11 AND TO THE OFFICE OF THE CITY MAYOR, HON. JUNARD ""AHONG"" CHAN WITH REFERENCE CODE NUMBER: IC-0V-20-0770.

Background

The crux of the complaint is as follows:

1.) There was failure on the part of the Lupon handling the case to explain to the complainant, Hilario Lim Sr. (now deceased) that the case filed has no basis in fact and in law. According to Mr. Garcia, the Lupon only listened on the side of the complainant in that civil case that resulted into the issuance of the Certificate to File Action. Mr. Lucenio Garcia further alleged that the Certificate to File Action in Brgy Case No. 99-073 issued on February 16, 1999 is likened into a Certification for Sale. This particular case was elevated to the regular court docketed as Civil Case No. 5192-L involving Lot No. 840-A. This case according to the complainant has become final and executory.

2.) The subsequent issuance of the Certification to File Action in a case docketed as Barangay Case No. 19-06-132 is an utter disrespect of the final and executory Order of the Court and constitute one of forum shopping.

3.) And some other minor irregularities as detailed in his complaint.

Observation

Council act on the complaint by requiring the respondent to submit a verified Answer within 15 days from receipt of the Notice to file Answer.

RECOMMENDATION:

RESOLVED, for Complainant Lucenio L. Garcia to require proper Verification of his Complaint filed against Lyndell T. Bullos as required by the rules.

Bulos of Barangay Pajo, Lapu-Lapu City, by Lucenio L. Garcia. This action was taken following a review by the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council) after receiving a letter-complaint from the Office of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Region VII. The complaint was deemed unverified and unsubstantiated, leading to its dismissal without prejudice for potential future re-filing. The key regulation here pertains to the handling of unverified complaints. It underscores the importance of substantiating allegations before proceeding with official actions, emphasizing transparency and fairness in local governance. Compliance obligations lie with both the complainant and the barangay official involved—Punong Barangay Lynelle T. Bulos—who must adhere to local laws and regulations moving forward. Enforcement mechanisms involve the City Mayor and the DILG Region VII, who will provide necessary guidance and information to all parties involved. This resolution does not specify significant penalties, fines, or sanctions directly related to the dismissed complaint. However, it highlights the committee report indicating that the case initially surfaced through the Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas). Citizens and businesses should understand that while this particular complaint has been dismissed, similar cases may still necessitate thorough investigations and adherence to established procedures. Additionally, the resolution emphasizes the critical role of verified evidence in local governance processes, reinforcing the need for diligent record-keeping and substantiation of claims.",

The key policy here revolves around requesting Senator Agapito Aquino to allocate ₱500,000. 00 from his pork barrel for constructing two units of a school building. This resolution underscores the urgent need for improved educational infrastructure in Ibo Elementary School, driven by the aspirations of both school administrators and students alike. The resolution mandates compliance with several obligations. Most significantly, it necessitates the submission of a formal request to Senator Aquino, detailing the proposed use of funds for the school building project. Compliance involves adherence to local government protocols for such requests, including preparation of necessary documentation outlining the project's necessity, budget breakdown, and anticipated benefits. Enforcement relies on the goodwill and discretion of Senator Aquino, who holds the power to approve or deny the allocation based on his pork barrel allocations. Failure to comply may result in the absence of funding for the project, thus hindering progress towards improving educational facilities in the area. Implementation would commence upon successful allocation of funds by Senator Aquino. Once secured, the city's Department of Public Works would be responsible for overseeing the construction process, ensuring adherence to local building codes and standards. The timeline for completion remains unspecified within this resolution, leaving room for further planning and coordination between the city government and potential contractors. Ultimately, this resolution emphasizes the importance of community advocacy in securing public resources for vital projects, while also highlighting the role of intergovernmental collaboration in achieving local development goals.",

The resolution requests the City Mayor, Ernest H. Weigel, Jr. , to issue an Executive Order forming an ad hoc committee responsible for revising and updating the city's numbering system. This initiative seeks to allocate P500,000. 00 from the annual budget for Cy 1996 to cover project expenses. Key regulatory measures include the necessity for a comprehensive study to modernize the numbering system for various structures, such as residential houses, hotels, apartments, businesses, and industrial establishments. This move is driven by the challenges posed by unnumbered properties, which impede postal service efficiency and complicate locating individuals during critical communications like telegrams. Compliance obligations involve cooperation with the proposed ad hoc committee, whose findings will guide the creation of a new numbering scheme. Enforcement mechanisms remain unspecified within this resolution, suggesting potential future directives from the mayor or relevant authorities. The primary enforcement mechanism and authority lie with the City Mayor following the issuance of the Executive Order. Penalties, fines, or sanctions are not explicitly mentioned, indicating their absence in this initial resolution. However, non-compliance could lead to delays or modifications in the project's implementation. Citizens and businesses must anticipate participation in the ad hoc committee's efforts and prepare for the introduction of a revised numbering system, likely within the upcoming fiscal year post-resolution enactment.",

Secretary to the Mayor",,1008-93,resolution,RESOLUTION NO. 1008-93,,1993-05-26,,,"Resolution No. 1008-93 primarily addresses the management of foreshore leases in Lapu-Lapu City, specifically targeting the application of Mrs. Dioscorinda Hayashi for a lease at Kaawagan, Talita. The key policy here is the city council's decision to limit the number of foreshore applications accepted from Hayashi, restricting her options to just one, in accordance with the city's policy and mayoral directives. This measure aims to prevent premature speculation regarding the foreshore leases. The resolution imposes significant compliance obligations on all parties involved. It directs the City Development Council to remand the previously approved CDC Resolution No. 93-03, which had endorsed Hayashi’s initial application. Any future foreshore lease applications must adhere to this policy, ensuring that no more than one application per applicant is considered concurrently. Compliance requires strict adherence to these guidelines, with non-compliance potentially leading to enforcement actions. Enforcement of this resolution falls under the jurisdiction of the City Development Coordinator, who will provide necessary guidance. Penalties or sanctions for violations are not explicitly stated in the resolution itself, suggesting that further legislation or administrative measures might outline such consequences. Businesses and individuals seeking foreshore leases must therefore anticipate stringent adherence to this single-application policy, alongside potential future clarification on enforcement mechanisms through additional ordinances or directives.",

PAKANG, M.D.",2008-01-16,,[12],"Resolution No. 479-2008 of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of the City of Lapu-Lapu approves two simple subdivisions, each involving the division of specific parcels of land into multiple lots for sale while retaining certain areas for the original owners or heirs. The first subdivision pertains to Lucia C. Amoria's lot (Lot No. 2875-C-4-A-2-A) from Lot No. 2875-C-4-A-2-B, situated in Basak, Lapu-Lapu City, covering 1,055 square meters.

The primary enforcement mechanism lies with the City's planning and development department, responsible for monitoring compliance and addressing violations. Effective dates for these subdivisions are not explicitly stated within the provided minutes, necessitating further reference to official city records for precise implementation timelines. In essence, this resolution allows for the creation of new residential or commercial plots while preserving portions of the original landholdings.
